## Introduction
Classification is a supervised learning technique in machine learning where the goal is to predict the categorical class labels of new instances based on past observations. The models are trained using labeled data and then used to classify new, unseen data.

## Types of Classification
### Binary Classification
Binary classification is the simplest form of classification where the target variable has only two possible outcomes. Examples include spam detection (spam or not spam) and disease diagnosis (disease or no disease).

#### Example Notebook:
- [Binary Classification Example](path/to/binary_classification_notebook.ipynb)

### Multiclass Classification
Multiclass classification involves predicting a target variable with more than two classes. Each instance is assigned to one and only one class. Examples include digit recognition (0-9) and species classification in biology.

#### Example Notebook:
- [Multiclass Classification Example](path/to/multiclass_classification_notebook.ipynb)

### Multilabel Classification
In multilabel classification, each instance can be assigned to multiple classes. This is useful in scenarios where an instance can belong to more than one category. Examples include text categorization (where a document can belong to multiple topics) and emotion detection in text.

## Model Implementations
In this repository, we provide implementations for various classification models including, but not limited to:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Neural Networks

Each implementation includes detailed explanations and code snippets to help you understand how these models work.
